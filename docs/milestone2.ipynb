    "## Introduction\n",
    "**Automatic Differentiation (auto_diff)** package is a python package that realizes forward mode automatic differentiation method on custom input functions. \n",
    "\n",
    "In scientific research or engineering projects, sometimes we would want to compute the derivative of certain functions (For example, the $f'(x)$ term in Newton's method.) For simple input functions, we can compute an exact analytical solution with ease. However, once the inputs become complicated, it may be hard or even impossible to calculate an analytical solution. This problem becomes especially intractable in deep learning, where we are interested in the derivative of model losses with respect to input features, both of which could be vectors with hundreds of dimensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "An alternative way is to compute the derivative using numerical methods like automatic differentiation. It breaks down large, complex input function into the product of elementary functions, whose derivatives are trivial to compute. By tracing the gradient of intermediate results and repeatedly applying Chain Rule, AutoDiff is able to compute the gradient of any input function in a certain direction. This carries significant importance as almost all machine learning methods rely on gradient descent, and the absolute prerequisite of gradient descent is to compute the gradient.    \n",

    "\n",
    "*This section provides a brief overview of the mechanism of AD. Users not interested in the math may skip to* **How to use *AutoDiff*** *section below*\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Elementary Operation**\n",
    "\n",
    "  The key concept of AD is to break down a complicated function into small, manageable steps, and solve each step individually. Typically, each step in AD would only perform one elementary operation. Here, \"Elementary Operations\" refer to both arithmetic operations (`+`, `-`, `*`, scalar division, power operation, etc.), and elementary functions (`exp`, `log`, `sin `, `cos`, etc.) These elementary operations should take only one or two inputs, and its partial derivative with respect to both inputs should be easy to compute. We would later chain these intermediate derivatives to get the overall result.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Chain Rule**\n",
    "\n",
    "  Chain rule in calculus is the rule to compute the derivative of compound functions. It allows us to write the derivative of compound function as the product of derivatives of simple functions. The simplest case is taking the derivative of a scalar function of only one scalar variable. \n",
    "  \n",
    "  $$\\frac{d}{dx}f(u(x))=\\frac{df(u)}{du}\\frac{du(x)}{dx}$$\n",
    "  \n",
    "  A more general case is to have a function $f$ of an n-dimension vector variable $\\textbf{x}=(x_1, x_2, ...x_n)$. Note that, this is a scalar function where output is a real number. Then, instead of derivate, we would like to compute the gradient of $f$ with respect to $\\textbf{x}$. Suppose $f$ is a function of vector $\\textbf{y}$, which itself is a function of vector $\\textbf{x}$. The chain rule for multivariate function is given by \n",
    "  \n",
    "  $$\\nabla_xf=\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y_1}\\nabla_xy_1+\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y_2}\\nabla_xy_2+... $$\n",
    "  $$=\\sum_i \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y_i}\\nabla_xy_i$$\n",
    "  \n",
    "  If we let the output be a real-value vector instead of a scalar, we will have the most general case. Let the function $f \\colon \\mathbb{R}^n \\to \\mathbb{R}^m$, the gradient is called the Jacobian matrix $J$, which is a $m$ x $n$ matrix such as it contains all the first-order partial derivatives. More specifically, we can write the Jacobian matrix such as \n",
    "\n",
    "  $$\n",
    "  \\mathbb{J}=\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc}\n",
    "  \\dfrac{\\partial \\mathbf{f}(\\mathbf{x})}{\\partial x_{1}} & \\cdots & \\dfrac{\\partial \\mathbf{f}(\\mathbf{x})}{\\partial x_{n}}\n",
    "  \\end{array}\\right]=\\left[\\begin{array}{c}\n",
    "  \\nabla^{T} f_{1}(\\mathbf{x}) \\\\\n",
    "  \\vdots \\\\\n",
    "  \\nabla^{T} f_{m}(\\mathbf{x})\n",
    "  \\end{array}\\right]=\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc}\n",
    "  \\dfrac{\\partial f_{1}(\\mathbf{x})}{\\partial x_{1}} & \\cdots & \\dfrac{\\partial f_{1}(\\mathbf{x})}{\\partial x_{n}} \\\\\n",
    "  \\vdots & \\ddots & \\vdots \\\\\n",
    "  \\dfrac{\\partial f_{m}(\\mathbf{x})}{\\partial x_{1}} & \\cdots & \\dfrac{\\partial f_{m}(\\mathbf{x})}{\\partial x_{n}}\n",
    "  \\end{array}\\right]\n",
    "  $$\n",
    "\n",
    "  The Jacobian of a vector-valued function in several variables generalizes the gradient of a scalar-valued function in several variables. We can then apply the chain rule using matrix operations similar to what we described before. \n",
    "    \n",
    "  The chain rule is exceptionally useful in AD method as we can imagine $\\textbf{y}$'s to be the intermediate result at each step, then by chain rule, the gradient of the interested function is just the production of gradients calculated in each small step.   \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Directional Derivative** $D_p$\n",
    " \n",
    "    An intuitive way to think of gradient is the direction in the n-dimensional space in which the function $f(x_1, x_2, ...,x_n)$ increases the fastest. For a function of a n-dimensional variable $\\textbf{x}$, its gradient is also an n-dimensional vector. Therefore, storing the gradient of every intermediate result in AD can be computationally costly (there might be millions of intermediate results in some complicated computations!) A remedy to this is to store the directional derivatives instead. The intuition behind directional derivative is that instead of the direction of steepest ascending, we would calculate the ascending rate along a certain direction of interest. Mathematically, the directional derivative of $f(\\textbf{x})$ in direction $\\textbf{p}$ is defined as the *projection* of gradient of $f$ on direction $\\textbf{p}$.\n",
    " \n",
    "    $$D_{\\textbf{p}}f=\\nabla_xf\\cdot \\textbf{p}$$\n",
    " \n",
    "    Therefore, instead of the gradient of each intermediate result, we would store only the directional derivative of each intermediate result. These directional derivatives are dot products of vectors, so they are all scalars themselves, which are much more efficient to store.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Formally, the vector $\\textbf{p}$ is called the seed vector. It is a parameter that given by user, which we project the gradient in its direction. It is also preferable to have a unit length.\n",
    " \n",
    "- **Computational Graph**\n",
    " \n",
    "    A computational graph is just a directed graph that describes how to break down the complicated function into elementary operations, and what are the intermediate values to be computed. The vertices in the computational graph are intermediate values, and the edges are elementary operations. An edge from $v_1$ to $v_2$ means to perform a certain elementary operation on intermediate value $v_1$ to get the next intermediate value $v_2$.\n",
    " \n",
    "- **Trace**\n",
    " \n",
    "    Traces simply mean the values we would like to keep track of in the forward pass in AD. For forward-mode AD, which is the backbone of this project, there are two traces, *Primal Trace* and *Tangent Trace*.\n",
    " \n",
    "    **Primal trace** stores the elementary operation to get one intermediate value from previous results.\n",
    " \n",
    "    For example $f(x)=e^{-\\sin(x)}$, its primal trace is then\n",
    " \n",
    "    $$v_0=x$$\n",
    "    $$v_1=\\sin(v_0)$$\n",
    "    $$v_2=-v_1$$\n",
    "    $$v_3=exp(v_2)$$\n",
    " \n",
    "    Primal trace provides the recipe for each intermediate value and eventually leads us to the final answer.\n",
    " \n",
    "    **Tangent trace** stores the *directional derivative* of an intermediate value. Thanks to Chain Rule, the tangent trace of $v_j$ can be written as the product of $\\frac{dv_j}{dv_i}D_pv_i$, where $v_i$ is some other intermediate value from which $v_j$ is computed.\n",
    " \n",
    "    Using the same example as before, the tangent trace of $f(x)$ is\n",
    " \n",
    "    $$D_pv_0=1$$\n",
    "    $$D_pv_1=\\frac{dv_1}{dv_0}D_pv_0=\\frac{d\\sin(v_0)}{dv_0}D_pv_0=\\cos(v_0)D_pv_0$$\n",
    "    $$D_pv_2=\\frac{d}{dv_1}(-v_1)D_pv_1=-D_pv_1$$\n",
    "    $$D_pv_3=\\frac{d}{dv_2}exp(v_2)D_pv_2=exp(v_2)D_pv_2$$\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Dual Number**\n",
    "\n",
    "    Dual numbers are expressions with of the form $x = a + b\\varepsilon$, where $a, b \\in R$, with selected $\\varepsilon$ such that $\\varepsilon^2 = 0$ while $\\varepsilon \\neq 0$. Dual Numbers have desirable properties that will later become useful for calculating derivatives.<br>\n",
    "    Given any real polynomial $P(x) = p_0 + p_1x + p_2x^2 + \\dots + p_nx^n$, let $x = a + b\\varepsilon$, \n",
    "    $$P(a + b\\varepsilon)= p_0 + p_1(a + b\\varepsilon) + \\cdots + p_n(a + b\\varepsilon)^n$$\n",
    "    Since $\\varepsilon^2 = 0$, all $p_i\\varepsilon^i = 0$ for any $i \\in [0,n]$\n",
    "    $$P(a + b\\varepsilon)= p_0 + p_1a + p_2a^2 + \\cdots + p_na^n + p_1 b\\varepsilon + 2 p_2 a b\\varepsilon + \\cdots + n p_n a^{n-1} b\\varepsilon$$\n",
    "    $$P(a + b\\varepsilon)= P(a) + bP'(a)\\varepsilon$$\n",
    "    We can use Taylor series of $f(x)$ expanding around $c = a + 0\\varepsilon$ to generalize the idea, \n",
    "$$f(x) = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{f^{(n)}(c)}{n !}(x-c)^n = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{f^{(n)}(a)}{n !}(b\\varepsilon)^n = f(a) + b\\varepsilon f'(a)$$\n",

Just combine `Variables` or other `Function` together, either using functions provided in `auto_diff` package (see the list of APIs above) or arithmetic operators would suffice. \n",

    "`varname` - a set of variables <br> \n",
    "`mode` - `f`/`b`, a flag to indicate forward or backward mode. Currently we have set `f` as default since we haven't implemetned backward mode. \n",
