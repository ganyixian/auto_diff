    "## Introduction\n",
    "**Automatic Differentiation (AD)** project is a python package that realizes forward mode automatic differentiation method on custom input fucntions. \n",
    "\n",
    "In scientific research or engineering projects, sometimes we would want to compute the derivative of certain functions (the $f'(x)$ term in Newton's method for example.) For simple input fucntions, we can compute an exact analytical solution with ease. However, once the inputs became complicated, it may be hard or even impossible to calculate an analytical solution. This problem becomes especially intractable in deep learning, where we are interested in the derivative of model losses with respect to input features, both of which could be vectors with hundreds of dimensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "An alternative way is to compute the derivative using numerical method like automatic differentiation. It breaks down large, complex input function into the product of elementary functions, whose derivative are trivial to compute. By tracing the gradient of intermediate results and repeatedly applying chain rule, AD is able to compute the gradient of any input function in a certain direction. This carries significant importance as almost all machine learning methods rely on gradient descent, and the absolute prerequisite of gradient descent is to compute the gradient.    \n",

    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "*This section provides a brief overview of the mechanism of AD. Users not interested in the math may skip to* **Usage** *section below*\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Elementary Operation**\n",
    "\n",
    "  The key concept of AD is to break down a complicated function into small, managable steps, and solving each step individually. Typically, each step in AD would only perform one elementary operation. Here, \"Elementary Operations\" refer to both arithmatic operation (`+`, `-`, `*`, scalar division, power operation, etc.), and elementary functions (`exp`, `log`, `sin `, `cos`, etc.) These elementary operations should take only one or two inputs, and its partial derivative with respect to both inputs should be easy to compute. We would later chain these intermediate derivatives to get the overall result.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Chain Rule**\n",
    "\n",
    "  Chain rule in calculus is the rule to compute the derivative of compound functions. It allows us to write the derivative of compound function as the product of derivatives of simple functions. The simpliest case is taking the derivative of a scalar function of only one scalar variable \n",
    "  \n",
    "  $$\\frac{d}{dx}f(u(x))=\\frac{df(u)}{du}\\frac{du(x)}{dx}$$\n",
    "  \n",
    "  A more general case is to have a function $f$ of a n-dimension vector variable $\\textbf{x}=(x_1, x_2, ...x_n)$. Then, instead of derivate, we would like to compute the gradient of $f$ with respect to $\\textbf{x}$. Suppose $f$ is a function of vector $\\textbf{y}$, which itself is a function of vector $\\textbf{x}$. The chain rule for multivariate function is given by \n",
    "  \n",
    "  $$\\nabla_xf=\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y_1}\\nabla_xy_1+\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y_2}\\nabla_xy_2+... $$\n",
    "  $$=\\sum_i \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y_i}\\nabla_xy_i$$\n",
    "  \n",
    "  The chain rule is exceptionally useful in AD method as we can imagine $\\textbf{y}$'s to be the intermediate result at each step, then by chain rule, the gradient of the interested funtion is just the production of gradients calculated in each small step. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Directional Derivative** $D_p$\n",
    " \n",
    "    An intuitive way to think of gradient is the direction in the n-dimensional space in which the function $f(x_1, x_2, ...,x_n)$ increases the fastest. For a function of a n-dimensional variable $\\textbf{x}$, its gradient is also a n-dimensional vector. Therefore, storing the gradient of every intermediate result in AD can be computationally costly (there might be millions of intermediate results in some complicated computation!) A remedy to this is to store the directional derivatives instead. The inituition behind directional derivative is that instead of the direction of fastese ascending, we would calculate the ascending rate along a certain direction of insterest. Mathematically, the directional derivative of $f(\\textbf{x})$ in direction $\\textbf{p}$ is defined as the *projection* of gradient of $f$ on direction $\\textbf{p}$.\n",
    " \n",
    "    $$D_{\\textbf{p}}f=\\nabla_xf\\cdot \\textbf{p}$$\n",
    " \n",
    "    Therefore, instead of the gradient of each intermediate result, we would store only the directional derivative of each intermediate result. These directional derivatives are dot products of vectors, so they are all scalars themselve, which are much more efficient to store.\n",
    " \n",
    "- **Computational Graph**\n",
    " \n",
    "    A computational graph is just a directed graph that descripts how to break down the complicated function into elementary operations, and what are the intermediate values to be computed. The vertices in the computational graph are intermediate values and the edges are elementary operations. An edge from $v_1$ to $v_2$ means to perform a certain elementary operation on intermediate value $v_1$ to get the next intermediate value $v_2$.\n",
    " \n",
    "- **Trace**\n",
    " \n",
    "    Traces simply mean the values we would like to keep track of in the forward pass in AD. For forward-mode AD, which is the backbone of this project, there are two traces, *Primal Trace* and *Tangent Trace*.\n",
    " \n",
    "    **Primal trace** stores the elementary operation to get one intermediate value from previous results.\n",
    " \n",
    "    For example $f(x)=e^{-\\sin(x)}$, its primal trace is then\n",
    " \n",
    "    $$v_0=x$$\n",
    "    $$v_1=\\sin(v_0)$$\n",
    "    $$v_2=-v_1$$\n",
    "    $$v_3=exp(v_2)$$\n",
    " \n",
    "    Primal trace provides the recipe for each intermediate value and eventually leads us to the final answer.\n",
    " \n",
    "    **Tangent trace** stores the *directional derivative* of an intermediate value. Thanks to chain rule, the tangent trace of $v_j$ can be written as the product of $\\frac{dv_j}{dv_i}D_pv_i$, where $v_i$ is some other intermediate value from which $v_j$ is computed.\n",
    " \n",
    "    Using the same example as before, the tangent trace of $f(x)$ is\n",
    " \n",
    "    $$D_pv_0=1$$\n",
    "    $$D_pv_1=\\frac{dv_1}{dv_0}D_pv_0=\\frac{d\\sin(v_0)}{dv_0}D_pv_0=\\cos(v_0)D_pv_0$$\n",
    "    $$D_pv_2=\\frac{d}{dv_1}(-v_1)D_pv_1=-D_pv_1$$\n",
    "    $$D_pv_3=\\frac{d}{dv_2}exp(v_2)D_pv_2=exp(v_2)D_pv_2$$\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Dual Number**\n",
    "\n",
    "    Dual numbers are expressions with of the form $x = a + b\\varepsilon$, where $a, b \\in R$, with selected $\\varepsilon$ such that $\\varepsilon^2 = 0$ while $\\varepsilon \\neq 0$. Dual Numbers have desirable properties that will later become useful for calculating derivatives.<br>\n",
    "    Given any real polynomial $P(x) = p_0 + p_1x + p_2x^2 + \\dots + p_nx^n$, let $x = a + b\\varepsilon$, \n",
    "    $$P(a + b\\varepsilon)= p_0 + p_1(a + b\\varepsilon) + \\cdots + p_n(a + b\\varepsilon)^n$$\n",
    "    Since $\\varepsilon^2 = 0$, all $p_i\\varepsilon^i = 0$ for any $i \\in [0,n]$\n",
    "    $$P(a + b\\varepsilon)= p_0 + p_1a + p_2a^2 + \\cdots + p_na^n + p_1 b\\varepsilon + 2 p_2 a b\\varepsilon + \\cdots + n p_n a^{n-1} b\\varepsilon$$\n",
    "    $$P(a + b\\varepsilon)= P(a) + bP'(a)\\varepsilon$$\n",
    "    We can use Taylor series of $f(x)$ expanding around $c = a + 0\\varepsilon$ to generalize the idea, \n",
    "$$f(x) = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{f^{(n)}(c)}{n !}(x-c)^n = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{f^{(n)}(a)}{n !}(b\\varepsilon)^n = f(a) + b\\varepsilon f'(a)$$\n",
    "    The first term is refered as primal trace and the latter term is refered as tangent trace, which are discussed above and crucial to our process of AD. \n",

    "`dual` module includes a single class called `DualNumber` and will be used to compute the primal and tangent trace in the computational graph. We plan to overload its `__add__` and `__mul__` dunder methods, and further implement methods like `_sin(), _cos(), _exp(), _log()` to support these elementary funtions on dual numbers. `DualNumber` is the absolute foundation of our AD package, and is planned to be implemented and comprehensively tested first.\n",
    "\n",
    "### `expression`\n",
    "\n",
    "Another module, which is also the core of our AD package, is `expression`. Essentially, all functions would be treated as some type of expressions. We are imaging to include an abstract base class `Expression` in this module, and two children classes, `Variable` and `Function` that inherit from it. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### `Expression`\n",
    "\n",
    "  This should be an abstract base class, and is not intended to be initialized directly. Its children classes, `Variable` and `Function` carry out the real work\n",
    "  \n",
    "#### `Variable`\n",
    "\n",
    "  Users are expected to declare the variables in their function via this class. An instance of `Variable` object would have two attributes, `name` and `value`. `name` is a string that gives a variable its name. Typically this would just be 'x' or 'y', but other names are also allowed. The name of a variable should be determined at initialization and is expected to be unique. `value` attribute stores the true value of that variable in the format of a `DualNumber`. The value of a variable is not required at initialization. The program would evaluate a given variable during evaluation. We would also overload the dunder `__add__` and `__mul__` method of `Variable` class so that these method would return an instance of `Function`.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  - **Evaluation**\n",
    "  \n",
    "    We decided to separate function declaration and evaluation so that users do not need to determine which point they want to calculate the gradient and what seed vector they want to use. We plan to overlaod the dunder `__call__` method of `Variable` class to make it callable. The overloaded `__call__` method would accept two `dict` as inputs, first of which specified the point to evaluate the function, and the the other spcify the seed vector. An ideal usage should be like this\n",
    "    \n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    x = Variable('x')\n",
    "    x(inputs={'x': 1}, seed={'x': 1})\n",
    "        \n",

    "    \n",
    "    On calling, the `__call__` method would find the appropriate value from `input`, according to its name. It will also look for its name in the `seed` dictionary. Then, the value of this variable is determined and stored as an instance of `DualNumber` whose real part is the value of variable, and dual part is its directional derivative. This dual number is then returned by `__call__`.\n",

    "   \n",
    "\n",
    "#### `Function`\n",
    "\n",
    "  A `Function` performs some elementary operation on other `Expression`(s). At initializaion, a `Function` object would take three parameters `exp1`, `exp2`, and `op`, where `exp2` is optional. `exp1` and `exp2` can be either `Function` or `Variable` objects, and they define what should the current function applied to. `op` should be a function object that we would provide as static functions within the `Function` class. These are just elementary operations, including but not limited to `add`, `mul`, `exp`, `sin`, etc. It is not necessary (nor expected) for users to know these static functions. The overloaded dunder classes and several pre-defined elementary function class that inherit from `Function` should take care of these details. \n",
    "  \n",
    "\n",
    "  - **Evaluation**\n",
    "  \n",
    "    Similar to `Variable` class, `Function` class is also callable. On calling, the `__call__` function would recursively calls the precursor expressions of current function, and then combine the result by calling the `op` static function defined before. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "Note that our implementation doesn't need a special graph node class to store the computational graph. By keeping track of precursor expressions within each `Function` object, our program constructs the computational graph automatically. \n",
